# debux-stubs - fork for use with shadow-cljs

shadow-cljs does not allow for dependencies to be exchanged for different build targts, or at least I did not figure out how to do it.
Also I do prefer to explicitly express different functionality.

With this fork I simply renamed the debux namespace to debux-stubs for all stubs intendend for production builds.

That way one can use shadow-cljs' :ns-aliases feature to switch between the two libraries.

`:release    {:build-options {:ns-aliases {debux.cs.core debux-stubs.cs.core}}}`
